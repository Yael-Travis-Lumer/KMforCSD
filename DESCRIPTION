Description: This package implements kernel machine regression based on a modification
    of the quadratic loss, as described in \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00991}{Kernel Machines for Current Starus Data}.
    The main function trains a kernel machine, and then uses it to predict the conditional expectation of the unobservable failure time.
